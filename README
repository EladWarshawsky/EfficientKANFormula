The original Efficient-KAN implementation has no formula conversion process, but is 10x faster than the original implementation.
This project is dedicate to being able to train Kolmogorov Arnold Networks quickly while still supporting interpretability.

Feel free to train a KAN on whatever task you like, then using the example script in solving.ipynb as a base, see if you can extract some interesting or informative formulas. 

TODO:
-Have more accurate formula approximation for the bsplines, it is not as good as it could be.
